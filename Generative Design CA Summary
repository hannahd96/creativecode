Generative Design Colour Experiment
-Project Idea Summary-

My concept is to utilize P5 JS to explore and experiment with image pixel arrays by altering the shape, size and colour of them. This 
involves inputting an image as a pixel array, employing some form of mathematics to alter the size of these pixels and outputting an 
image with different sized pixels. The outputted image will ideally convey qualities of Cubism art / Abstract art as all pixels will be 
different sizes and appear along side each other. 
In addition the pixels in the image pixel array will change colour and will overlap other pixels. 
With all these image attributes altered, the program has the potential to create unique and interesting images.
