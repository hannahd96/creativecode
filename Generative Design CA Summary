Generative Design Colour Experiment

# Project Idea Summary

Introduction
My concept is to utilize P5 JS to explore and experiment with image pixel arrays by altering the shape, size and colour of them. This 
involves inputting an image as a pixel array, employing some form of mathematics to alter the size of these pixels and outputting an 
image with different sized pixels.  In addition the pixels in the image pixel array will change colour and will overlap other pixels. 

Main
The outputted image will ideally convey qualities of Cubism art / Abstract art as all pixels will be different sizes and appear along 
side each other. Because an image is loaded as an array of numbers (data), these numbers can be adjusted to generate an interesting 
piece of artwork / an image. I will be using generative-gestaltung to assist me in executing this 

Conclusion
With all these image attributes altered, the program has the potential to create unique and interesting images.
